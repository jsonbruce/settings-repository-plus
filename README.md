# Settings Repository Plus
This plugin is based on the original <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/plugins/settings-repository">Settings Repository</a> plugin.
To enhance the original plugin.

# Installation

1. Disable the original `Settings Repository` plugin in Settings | Plugins
2. Install from Settings | Plugins | Browse repositories -> type in `Settings Repository Plus`.


# Configuration

Use `File -> Settings Repositoryâ€¦` to configure.

Specify URL and branch of upstream Git repository. File URL is supported, you will be prompted to init repository if specified path is not exists or repository is not created.
[GitHub](https://www.github.com) could be used to store settings.

Synchronization is performed automatically after successful completion of "Update Project" or "Push" actions. Also you can do sync using "VCS -> Sync Settings". The idea is do not disturb you. If you invoke such actions, so, you are ready to solve possible problems.

## Authentication
On first sync you will be prompted to specify username/password. In case of GitHub strongly recommended to use an [access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use) (leave password empty if you use token instead of username). Bitbucket [doesn't support tokens](https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/7735).

If you still want to use username/password instead of access token or your Git hosting provider doesn't support it, recommended to configure [git credentials helper](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git).

OS X Keychain is supported. It means that your credentials could be shared between all IntelliJ Platform based products (you will be prompted to grant access if origin application differs from requestor application (credentials were saved in IntelliJ IDEA, but requested from WebStorm).


# Suggestion
Create a remote repository named `IntelliJSettings` and sync to different branches:

- idea-linux
- idea-windows
- pycharm-linux
- pycharm-windows
- ...
